# Nihilquest
This game was made for a school project at NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences. The objective of the game is to go to lower and lower in a dungeon. There is no end goal, you can go down infinitely. On your way you will fight various monsters and a boss at each level defeating said boss will grant you passage to the next level. After killing all enemies in normal rooms an item will spawn that increases your stats. There is also a treasure room with an active item. Each active item requires mana which you get by defeating enemies.

## Controls
* Left-click : Movement<br>

If an item will give an effect it will only last until all enemies in the room are defeated.
